Detect and classify wildlife from camera traps using computer vision and object detection using state-of-the-art, real-time object detection systems

Our approach was to test out the performance of YOLO v5, YOLO v7, and Faster RCNN to determine which is the best-performing model and use this model to be able to track animals on video using Deepsort. We will discuss all the aspects of this approach below in our blog.
